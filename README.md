# Web Forms from Scratch
In this, I created a website to understand how web forms work and are designed. The site is very basic, but design was not the focus here.


# What Did I Learn?
I learned many skills, including basic HTML coding, along with coding in HTML forms to gain information from users. I also learned web form best practices - such as the F pattern that users typically view a page with, not to overload the user with more than 5-7 questions per page, and to change the question format (multiple choice, short answer, drop-downs, etc.) often!
